			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Well, this should be my bio, but I don't know what really to put here. So, I'll just 
				put some generic stuff. My name is Aarij and I go to Northwestern and some other stuff 
				whatever whatever. I don't think that if I had a full website that I'd put a bio because 
				I feel like everything said here would probably be said elsewhere, and anything not said 
				elsewhere probably doesnt need to be said? Anyways, this seems about long enough. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's another paragraph for good measure though.
			</p>
			<p>
				I could even put a third, but if you have three paragraphs of bio you're probably doing too much.
