		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Hi! My name is Aarij, and I'm a student at Northwestern. I'm getting a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and an
			M.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern University (through a 4 year BS/MS program).
			Last summer I interned at TD Ameritrade as an Active Trader Intern, and this summer I interned at J.P.
			Morgan as an Interest Rate Options Trading Analyst.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm really interested in trading and computer science. I like trading because of how it focuses on quickly
			analyzing and reacting to information, and I like computer science because of how it's used to improve
			processes and drive change. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, I'm always looking to learn something new and work on challenging, interesting problems.
		</p>
