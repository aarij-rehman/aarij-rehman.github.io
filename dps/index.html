		<h1>Denver Public Schools Routing</h1>
		<a href="https://github.com/aarij-rehman/denver-public-schools"><img src="/img/dps.svg"></img></a>
		<p class="paragraph">In this project, I helped the DPS School district route vehicles that were used for
			delivering lunches
			to students. DPS has a system where instead of every school having a cafeteria, some schools do and produce
			extra meals which are delivered to those who don't.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">This was a multi stage project where I worked with a team, and I was responsible
			for the routing solution. This problem is infamously known as the Vehicle Routing Problem or VRP for short.
			It's an NP-Hard problem which is similar to putting together several Travelling Salesman Problems together.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
			Without an industrial grade solver, I knew getting an optimal solution was out of the picture. So, to come
			up with a feasible solution, I adapted an existing algorithm - the Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm. To
			address the specific constraints of this problem, though, I read through academic papers and created some of
			my own solutions to make sure generated solutions are entirely feasible. After <i>a lot</i> of mistakes, I
			was able to produce a solution which proposed a routing scheme that allowed DPS to reduce their current 11
			routes to 9.
