            <p class="paragraph">In this project, I helped the DPS School district route vehicles that were used for delivering lunches 
                to students. DPS has a system where instead of every school having a cafeteria, some schools do and produce
                extra meals which are delivered to those who don't. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">This was a multi stage project where I worked with a team, and I was responsible
                for the routing solution. This is essentially known as the Vehicle Routing Problem or VRP for short.
                It's an NP-Hard problem which is similar to putting together several Travelling Salesman Problems together.

            <p class="paragraph">I'll put more information later, but I need to work on cs 213 right now :)</p>
